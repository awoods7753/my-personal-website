            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <span>Hello! My name is Austin Woods and I am currently in
              school to become a software developer with Flatiron
              Schools. I have a Master's Degree in Organizational 
              Leadership and Management and a Bachelor's Degree in
              Criminal Justice with a minor in Political Science.
              I recently left the Army National Guard as an Air
              Defense Officer where I conducted peacekeeping missions
              and a mission in Washington D.C. working under President
              Trump. Before starting school, I was a Security Manager
              for the largest whiskey distillery in the world. I am
              OSHA 30 and HAZMAT certified and hold many certifications
              for FEMA and Emergency Rescue. Feel free to email me with
              any questions!
